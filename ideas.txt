Discussion: what makes a reddit comment popular?
    As a rule of thumb the following are good reasons to upvote a comment (written in no particular order):
       funny, witty clever, smart, it is relatable; it is exactly how you feel about the post or comment you're replying to.

idea: Perhaps some words evoke a sense of distaste and therefore make a comment less popular, and some words do the exact opposite.
    misspelled and poorly written comments are less likely to be popular

side note: how is popularity measured?
    for one it could be just measured by the # of upvotes. However it may have been made (intentionally) arbitrary
    by the prof. Why is that? maybe so that the assignment is more about using statistics without knowing really whats going on.
